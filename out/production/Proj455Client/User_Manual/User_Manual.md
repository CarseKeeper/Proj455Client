## *Server-side Program*

### Press Play

That's right! Start the executable and give your clients your
IP that will show in your terminal.

### Logging

Standard logs will be in white and errors will appear in red.
Errors will be logged in the server and sent to the client.

### Request Response Model

The Server Client pair uses an in-house communication method
that passes serialized request and response objects to each other.
This helps protect data and makes error handling easy.

### Database

The database used for the server of this project is SQLlite which when opened up looks like this:
